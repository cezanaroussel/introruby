# data types are diff types of data we can use in ruby
# you can store data in variables
# 1st type! a string is basically just plain text
# ex of a variable with a string value inside it below
name = "Brent"
age = 30
# 30 is an integer, a whole number
# a decimal is different, referred to as floating point numbers
gpa = 3.9

# 2nd type! a boolean is a t/f data type
isfemale = true
istall = false

 # setting a variable to 'nil' means it has no value
 flaws = nil

#how to print out quotation marks within a string
puts "\"Giraffe\" Academy"

# convert to all uppercase letters
#you can downcase too as you see below
phrase = "Giraffe Academy"
puts phrase.upcase()
puts phrase.downcase()
