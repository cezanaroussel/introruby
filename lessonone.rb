#when dealing with ruby you'll be dealing with a lot of data
#look at the name/age, this is where variables come in
#we want to track and maintain them
#we can put name and age in a container
#the container is called a variable
#give it a descriptive name and give it a _
character_name = "John"
character_age = "35"
puts ("There once was a man named " + character_name)
puts ("he was " + character_age +" years old.")

#you will notice the name changes halfway through the story
#due to the ability to change the variable

character_name = "Thomas"
puts ("He really liked the name " + character_name)
puts ("but didn't like being " + character_age)

# we can represent / store different types of data inside of our variables
# next lesson, data types
